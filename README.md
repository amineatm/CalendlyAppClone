# Important Project Requirements

**Stream API:**

You must make use of the Java Stream API wherever it is applicable, especially for collection processing, filtering, mapping, aggregation, and other data operations. Clearly highlight these usages in your code and documentation.

**Unit Testing:**

Implement unit tests for your business logic using JUnit or a similar testing framework. Include instructions for running your test suite and ensure your tests cover major functionalities and edge cases.

**Singleton Pattern:**

Where a class should have only one instance (for example, for managing resources, database connections, configuration, etc.), apply the Singleton design pattern.

## 1. Problem Description

Conduit App is a Medium.com-style blogging platform API that addresses the need for a clean, modular, and secure backend for publishing articles, managing user profiles, and enabling community engagement.

---

## 2. User Stories

Describe the system from the user's perspective using user stories:

✅ General User:

- As a visitor, I want to register for an account so that I can create and manage content.
- As a user, I want to log in securely using JWT so that I can access personalized features.
- As a user, I want to view articles from other users so that I can stay informed and engaged.
- As a user, I want to favorite articles so that I can easily find them later.
- As a user, I want to follow other authors so that I can see articles from people I like.

📝 Author:

- As an author, I want to create and publish articles so that I can share my thoughts with the community.
- As an author, I want to edit or delete my own articles so that I can keep my content up to date.
- As an author, I want to add tags to articles so that readers can find them more easily.

## 3. Functional Requirements

🔐 Authentication:

- Users can register with an email and password.
- Users can log in securely and receive a JWT token.
- JWT is used to secure all protected endpoints.
- No role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented — all users have the same privileges.

📝 Article Management:

- Authenticated users can create and delete articles.
- Articles can be favorited by other users.
- No update/edit or locking/approval mechanism is implemented yet.

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Social Features:

- Users can follow or unfollow other users.
- A personalized feed is available showing articles from followed users.

💬 Comments:

- Commenting features are not available in the current implementation (not found in controller).

🏷️ Tags:

- Tags are auto-created when articles are posted.
- There is no tag-based filtering in the current implementation.

📁 Customer & Region Modules:

- The app includes additional modules for Customer and Region management.
- These are likely for demo, internal use, or extended business logic, not directly tied to blogging features.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

🔐 Security:

- JWT is used to secure API endpoints.
- No password hashing or encryption is currently applied.

⚙️ Performance:

- Backend is built with Spring Boot for fast REST API responses.
- Basic pagination is applied to improve API efficiency.

🔁 Reliability:

- Stateless API improves resilience.
- Backend logic is grouped by clean controller-service layers.

📈 Scalability:

-The system can be scaled by deploying multiple instances behind a load balancer.

👤 Usability:

- The API follows RESTful standards and returns consistent JSON responses.
- Integrated with Swagger for easy API testing and documentation.

## 5. Architecture of Project

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5.1 Overview

The project follows a standard layered architecture, which promotes separation of concerns and modularity. The main layers are:

1. Controller Layer (controller):

- Handles HTTP requests and responses.
- Maps REST endpoints to service logic.
- Example: ArticleController, UserController.

2- Service Layer (service.impl):

- Contains the core business logic.
- Orchestrates operations across repositories and other services.
- Example: ArticleService, ProfileService.

3- Repository Layer (repository):

- Interfaces with the database using Spring Data JPA.
- Provides CRUD operations on entities.
- Example: ArticleRepository, UserRepository

4- Domain Layer (domain):

- Contains entity classes representing database tables.
- Used directly by JPA repositories and services.
- Example: Article, User, Comment

5- DTO Layer (dto):

- Holds Data Transfer Objects used for input/output operations.
- Helps isolate domain models from external clients.
- Example: ArticleRequest, UserResponse

6- Security Layer (security):

- Manages JWT authentication and current user context.
- Example: JwtAuthenticationFilter, SecurityConfig

7- Configuration Layer (config, autoconfigure):

- Holds configuration classes for Swagger, CORS, and JPA.
- Example: SwaggerConfig, PersistenceConfig

8- Utility & Error Handling (util, error):

- Util: contains helpers like SlugUtil, HashUtil.
- Error: handles global exception responses and validation errors.

### 5.3 Technologies Used

🖥️ Backend:

- Java 11
- Spring Boot 2.5.7
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Security (JWT-based)
- Lombok
- MySQL
- H2 (dev database)
- Swagger (Springfox 3.0.0)

🌐 Frontend:

- Angular 16
- Nx Workspace
- RxJS & NgRx
- TypeScript
- Storybook
- Jest & Cypress
- Firebase Tools (deployment)

### 5.4 Layer Descriptions

- Presentation Layer: Handles incoming HTTP requests using controllers. It exposes REST APIs and maps them to appropriate services.

- Service Layer: Contains business logic. It processes data, applies rules, and coordinates between the controller and repository layers.

- Data Access Layer: Uses Spring Data JPA to interact with the database. It provides CRUD operations through repositories.

- Database: MySQL is used as the main relational database to persist all entities like users, articles, comments, etc.

## 11. Installation & Deployment

🔁 Clone the Repository:
    git clone <https://github.com/amineatm/Conduit-App.git>
    cd conduit-app

🧱 Backend Setup (Spring Boot - Java):
    1. Create MySQL database:
        CREATE DATABASE conduit_db;
    2. Configure the connection in application.properties or application.yml: eg. application.properties:
        spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/conduit_db
        spring.datasource.username=root
        spring.datasource.password=your_password
    3. Seed initial data from data.sql (already configured by Spring Boot):
        -- Will auto-insert tags like 'coding', 'angular', 'java', etc.
    4. Run the app:
        ./gradlew bootRun or (run it from your IDE).

    The backend will be accessible at:
👉 <http://localhost:8092/swagger-ui/index.html/> (for API docs)
